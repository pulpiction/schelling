# Schelling Model Implementation 

This repository contains a well-known model for residential segregation dynamics called schelling model. The original paper is included in the repository for reference. The agent-based grid lattice models such as schelling model has close connections with the ising model, which can be a close approximations to the schelling model dynamics. The future updates will investigate the relationships between these two models.

I just made this for fun after seeing an exhibit at Chicago Cultural Center.
